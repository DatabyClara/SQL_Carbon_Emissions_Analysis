# Carbon Emissions Analysis Using SQL
The dataset, sourced from [Nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9), contains emissions data from 2013 to 2017 for various products, industries, companies, and countries, categorized by lifecycle stage (upstream, operations, and downstream). The data was collected through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), where companies voluntarily reported their PCFs in response to CDP's Climate Change Questionnaire.

### What was done?
Analyzed a dataset of Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) using SQL in a PostgreSQL environment to identify top carbon emitters and patterns across industries, lifecycle stages, and countries from 2013 to 2017 in our database.

### Objective
Analyze Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs), which is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with a specific product that is measured in CO‚ÇÇe (carbon dioxide equivalent), in order to:
- Identify the major sources of emissions across industries, products, and countries both throughout the entire study period and specifically in 2017.
- Understand how emissions are distributed across different lifecycle stages (upstream, operations, downstream).

### üìä Results:

**Most recent data shows (2017):**
- Materials and Capital Goods were the top emitting industries in 2017.
- The Food, Beverages & Tobacco industry showed a consistent reduction in emissions over time, even with consistent data reporting.
- The product with the highest emissions recorded in 2017 in this dataset was TCDE, from the Materials industry. Lifecycle analysis for this product showed that most emissions occurred in the upstream stage. Emission breakdown: 60% upstream, 34.4% operations, and less than 1% downstream.

**Over the entire study period (2013‚Äì2017):**
- The top three emitting industry sectors in this dataset were Electrical Equipment and Machinery, Automobiles & Components, and Materials.
- Spain had the highest total emissions in this dataset, mainly due to the Electrical Equipment and Machinery sector in 2015. Germany, Japan, and the U.S. followed as top emitters.
- China and India reported relatively low emissions, likely due to data gaps or underreporting.

### üìù Recommendations
- Prioritize policies and investments to decarbonize the Materials and Capital Goods industries, as they were the largest emitters in 2017.
- Pursue cleaner technologies and sustainable production processes for the products with the highest carbon emissions.
- Understand the key products within the target industries (e.g., Materials) to develop more efficient and scalable decarbonization solutions.
- Encourage more companies to share their emissions data and keep updating it regularly to have accurate information.

### üìà Potential Extensions
- Compare carbon footprints across similar products to highlight best practices.
- Perform time series forecasting to predict future emissions and evaluate intervention scenarios.
- Collect more recent data to monitor ongoing trends and evaluate the effectiveness of emission reduction efforts.
- Develop targeted decarbonization strategies for upstream, operations, and downstream stages.
- Use Machine Learning models to detect unusual reporting patterns or data inconsistencies.
