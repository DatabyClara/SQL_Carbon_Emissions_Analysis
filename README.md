# Carbon Emissions Analysis Using SQL
All SQL queries applied in this project are available in the "SQL_Queries.sql" section above. However, a small sample of SQL queries will be displayed at the end of this page.

The dataset, sourced from [Nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9), contains emissions data from 2013 to 2017 for various products, industries, companies, and countries, categorized by lifecycle stage (upstream, operations, and downstream).

### What was done?
Analyzed a dataset of Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) using SQL in a PostgreSQL environment to identify top carbon emitters and patterns across industries, lifecycle stages, and countries from 2013 to 2017 in our database.

### Objective
Analyze Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs), which is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with a specific product that is measured in CO‚ÇÇe (carbon dioxide equivalent), in order to:
- Identify the major sources of emissions across industries, products, and countries both throughout the entire study period and specifically in 2017.
- Understand how emissions are distributed across different lifecycle stages (upstream, operations, downstream).

### üìä Results:

**Most recent data shows:**
- Materials and Capital Goods were the top emitting industries in 2017.
- The Food, Beverages & Tobacco industry showed a consistent reduction in emissions over time, even with consistent data reporting.
- The company that had the most emissions in 2017 was Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, located in Japan, due to a product (TCDE) in the Materials industry group, which generated the highest emissions during the upstream stage.
Emission breakdown: 60% upstream, 34.4% operations, and less than 1% downstream.

**Over the entire study period:**
- Spain reported the highest total emissions, mainly driven by the Electrical Equipment and Machinery sector in 2015.
- Belgium had only one company reporting emissions, Solvay S.A., indicating strong commitment, transparency, and sector leadership. This provides the company with a competitive sustainability advantage within the country.

### üìù Recommendations
-Prioritize policies and investments to decarbonize the Materials and Capital Goods industries, as they were the largest emitters in 2017.
- Pursue cleaner technologies and sustainable production processes for the products with the highest carbon emissions.
- Understand the key products within the target industries (e.g., Materials) to develop more efficient and scalable decarbonization solutions.
- Encourage more companies to share their emissions data and keep updating it regularly to have accurate information.

### üìà Potential Extensions
-Compare carbon footprints across similar products to highlight best practices.
- Perform time series forecasting to predict future emissions and evaluate intervention scenarios.
- Collect more recent data to monitor ongoing trends and evaluate the effectiveness of emission reduction efforts.
- Develop targeted decarbonization strategies for upstream, operations, and downstream stages.
- Use Machine Learning models to detect unusual reporting patterns or data inconsistencies.
